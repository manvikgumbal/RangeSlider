# RangeSlider
This is the Range slider easy to use and manager UI from story board. Just drag and drop the class in your project. Give a class to UIView and you are ready to use.     


To Get the values on slider just use:    
func didChangeSliderValues(lowerValue: Double, upperValue: Double?).     

Code is written in Swift clearly.

Happy Using :-)
